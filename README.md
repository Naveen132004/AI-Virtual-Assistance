Nyra – Personal AI Assistant
Nyra is a voice-controlled AI assistant created using Python. It helps users perform daily tasks on their computer using voice commands and keyboard shortcuts. Nyra listens to your commands and responds like a smart digital helper.
It can open websites, launch apps, search online, give news or weather updates, send emails, and even control YouTube — all just by speaking. The assistant also provides basic system information and can be started or stopped using hotkeys.
Nyra is built using modules like:
speech_recognition for listening
pyttsx3 for speaking
keyboard for hotkey control
webbrowser, os, and datetime for system tasks
It runs without a graphical interface for now, but a GUI version can be added later.
